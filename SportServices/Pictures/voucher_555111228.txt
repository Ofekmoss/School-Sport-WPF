Dear yahavbrb,

yes I will , sometimes this happens with international sales. So far the shoes usually show up, I will keep checking. Thanks for being patient.

Dear yahavbrb,

Hi
Just got of the phone with the USPS and somehow your shoes went to Brasil. The USPS is now checking with the Brasil PO and trying to determine if the shoe is headed to you or back to us. Once we hear back we can give you a refund if they are on the way back to us, or let you know when to expect them if they sent them to you.

Dear sneakermn1,

I checked with my post office and they say it never arrived my country.

Checking USPS website I found this:
https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction_input?qtc_tLabels1=CQ021460047US&qtc_senddate1=&qtc_zipcode1=

It appears to be stuck somewhere, but when I tried to contact USPS customer service it said:

---
For International inquiries, per the Universal Postal Union (UPU), if your inquiry pertains to the status of an article mailed from a US address to an address outside of the US, you must contact the US sender and ask them to initiate an inquiry with the US Postal Service by calling 1-800-222-1811. If your inquiry pertains to an article that was mailed to a US address from an address outside of the US, please contact the Foreign Postal Administration of the country where the article was sent from, who will then contact the United States Postal Service.
---

Can you please initiate inquiry with them and see where the package is stuck?

Thanks in advance,
Yahav

Dear sneakermn1,
